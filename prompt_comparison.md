# Sentiment Analysis Prompt Comparison

## Overview
This document compares the different prompts used across the sentiment analysis systems to understand why performance varies between tests.

## 1. **Live Sentiment Service Prompt** (`sentiment_service.py`)

**Location**: `sentiment_service.py` lines 714-748  
**Used By**: Production system, Traditional analysis in RAG comparison test  
**Model**: Claude-3.5-Sonnet (via load balancer)

```
Analyze the following news article about {ticker} and determine if it suggests a BUY, SELL, or HOLD signal based on the sentiment and potential market impact.

Article Content:

4. Rate confidence as high, medium, or low
5. Give a brief explanation (1-2 sentences)

[USA tickers only:]
Special consideration: If the article discusses Bitcoin, cryptocurrency investments, or crypto-related business activities by the company, these should generally be viewed as high-confidence market movers. Bitcoin/crypto news often has significant immediate market impact on stock prices.

Respond in this exact JSON format:
{
    "ticker": "{ticker}",
    "sentiment": "positive/negative/neutral",
    "recommendation": "BUY/SELL/HOLD",
    "confidence": "high/medium/low",

- Detailed instructions with clear categories
- Structured JSON response
- Scraped full content (up to 6000 chars)

Please analyze the sentiment and provide a trading recommendation. Consider:
- Market impact potential
- Company fundamentals mentioned
- Overall tone and sentiment
- Trading opportunities

Respond with JSON in this exact format:
{
    "recommendation": "BUY/HOLD/SELL",

## 3. **RAG-Enhanced Prompt** (`tests/rag_comparison_test.py`)

**Location**: `tests/rag_comparison_test.py` lines 673-688  
**Used By**: RAG vs Traditional comparison test  
**Model**: Claude-3.5-Sonnet (via load balancer)

```
Based on these similar historical examples and their outcomes:

{rag_context}

Now analyze this new article:
{clean_content}

IMPORTANT: Consider the historical patterns above. Look for opportunities that match successful patterns from TRUE_BULLISH examples. Don't be overly conservative - if the article shows strong positive signals similar to past winners, recommend BUY with appropriate confidence.

Key considerations:
- If similar to TRUE_BULLISH examples with high similarity: Consider BUY with high confidence
- If shows positive signals but uncertain: BUY with medium confidence is better than missing opportunities
- Only use HOLD if genuinely neutral or similar to FALSE_PUMP/NEUTRAL examples

Provide sentiment analysis considering the historical patterns shown above.
Respond with JSON: {"action": "BUY/HOLD/SELL", "confidence": "high/medium/low", "reasoning": "explanation based on historical patterns"}
```

**Key Features:**
- Historical context from similar examples
- Outcome-weighted pattern analysis
- Explicit bias toward BUY recommendations
- Anti-conservative instructions
- Pattern-based reasoning

| **Sonnet Test** | `"You are a financial analyst expert at analyzing news sentiment and its impact on stock prices. Always respond with valid JSON.\n\n{prompt}"` |
| **RAG Test** | Same as above (uses live service for traditional analysis) |
| **New Experimental** | Same system prompt for consistency |

---

## 6. **Key Differences Analysis**

### **Content Length**
- **Live Service**: Up to 6000 characters (full scraped content)
- **Sonnet Test**: Up to 1500 characters (truncated)
- **RAG Test**: Full content (uses live service for traditional)
- **New Experimental**: 1500 characters (following successful Sonnet test pattern)

### **Context Awareness**
- **Live Service**: Ticker-specific, country-aware, Bitcoin consideration
- **Sonnet Test**: Generic, no ticker context
- **RAG Test**: Historical pattern context, outcome-weighted
- **New Experimental**: Breakout vs pump-dump focused, no ticker bias

### **Instruction Style**
- **Live Service**: Detailed, structured instructions
- **Sonnet Test**: Simple, direct approach
- **RAG Test**: Pattern-focused, anti-conservative bias

## 7. **NEW EXPERIMENTAL PROMPT STRATEGIES** ðŸŽ¯

### **4A - Breakout vs Pump-Dump**: Fundamental catalysts vs hype detection
### **4B - Catalyst Strength**: Quality and sustainability ranking
### **4C - Institutional Appeal**: Professional vs retail money attraction
### **4D - Timing Analysis**: Immediate vs delayed impact assessment  
### **4E - Concrete vs Speculative**: Measurability and specificity focus

**Common Design Principles:**
- Keep 1500 character limit (successful from Sonnet test)
- Maintain simple, direct approach
- Focus specifically on 100-400% breakout identification
- Include explicit pump-and-dump risk assessment
- Demand concrete evidence over speculation
- Use same JSON response format for consistency

## 8. **Performance Impact Analysis**

### **Why Sonnet Test Shows Higher Performance:**

1. **Simpler Prompt**: Less complex instructions may lead to more consistent responses
2. **Shorter Content**: 1500 char limit vs 6000 may focus on key information
3. **No Ticker Bias**: Generic analysis without company-specific considerations
4. **Direct Format**: Streamlined JSON response structure

### **Why RAG Shows Lower Traditional Performance:**

1. **Same Underlying Service**: RAG test uses the live sentiment service for "traditional" analysis
2. **Full Content Processing**: Processes complete articles (potentially noisier)
3. **Production Complexity**: Includes country lookup, content scraping, caching

### **Why Live Service May Vary:**

1. **Content Source**: Scraped content vs provided content
2. **Context Complexity**: More sophisticated but potentially confusing instructions
3. **Country-Specific Logic**: Additional complexity for Bitcoin/crypto considerations

### **Expected Performance of New Experimental Prompts:**

1. **4A-4E should outperform** current prompts by:
   - Explicitly targeting the 100-400% vs pump-dump distinction
   - Focusing on concrete catalysts over general sentiment
   - Including specific pump-and-dump risk assessment
   - Demanding measurable evidence over speculation

## 9. **Recommendations**

### **For Consistent Testing:**
1. Use identical prompts across all test systems
2. Standardize content length limits (1500 chars based on Sonnet success)
3. Remove system-specific features during comparison

### **For Production Optimization:**
1. Test new experimental prompts 4A-4E against current system
2. Consider simplifying the live service prompt
3. Evaluate country-specific logic effectiveness

### **For Future Comparisons:**
1. Create isolated prompt comparison tests with new experimental variants
2. Control for content length and complexity
3. Separate model performance from prompt engineering effects
4. **PRIORITY**: Test experimental prompts against TRUE_BULLISH vs FALSE_PUMP dataset
